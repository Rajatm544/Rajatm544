I am a full stack developer with an experience of building applications using the MERN stack. The possibility of converting an idea to an actual entity, is what excites me the most about software development, and it serves as a motivation for me to trudge along and complete a project that I begin!

I am a keen problem solver, and have been working hard at getting better at it. Ever since I've figured out the way to weave my interests in problem solving with the passion of becoming a software developer, it has been quite a rewarding endeavour. I am presently looking for opportunities to put this passion to good use, by working on my personal projects.
