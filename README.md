# Hi, I'm Rajat

I am a full stack developer with an experience of building applications using the MERN stack. I do this because I enjoy the process of solving problems using the code that I write. The possibility of converting an idea from a concept to an actual entity is what excites me the most about software development, and it also serves as a motivation for me to trudge along, and complete a project that I begin.

I am a keen problem solver, and have been working hard at getting better at it. It has been an itch ever since I was introduced to programming, back in the 7th grade. Since then, I have been fascinated with solving coding problems. But ever since I've figured out the way to weave my interests in problem solving with the passion of becoming a software developer, it has been a rewarding endeavour. I am presently looking for opportunities to put this passion to good use, whether it be by working on my personal projects or through the medium of internships.
